CS225 Programming Languages: Homework 4
Due date: Friday, December 2 by 11:59PM
Submission:: Please submit your solutions to Problems 1-6 (and 8 for Graduate Students) as one file, and
your completed catml.ml file to answer Problem 7. You can embed your solutions to other problems in
that file in comments if you prefer. All submissions must be made electronically in Blackboard.


Problem 1 (5 points). Define the factorial function in CatML using Fix (i.e., primitive recursion, not the
Y or Z combinator). Your definition should run correctly on examples.

for ocaml...
let rec fact n = 
  if n <= 1 then 1 else n * fact (n - 1)

for catml...

Let mult = (Fix m . x . Fun y . If x = 0 Then 0 Else y + ((m (x - 1)) y)) In
Let fact = (Fix f . y . If y = 0 Then 1 Else (mult y) (f (y-1))) In
fact 4



Definition 1.4 (Closed expressions) An expression e is closed iff it contains no free variable occurences.

Problem 2 (5 points). For each of the following CatML expressions e, state whether e is closed or not,
and why:
a. 1 + 2 - is closed, it contains no free variables
b. x - is not closed becuae it contains a free variable which is x
c. (Fun x . x + y) - is not closed, it contains y which is a free variable
d. (Fun x .(Fun y . x + y)) - is closed, there are no free variables, each are bound by the calling of its function
e. (Fun x .(Fun y . x + y))(y) - is not closed, when y is put into the function it is free


Problem 3 (5 points). For each of the following substitutions e[v/x] 
specify e such that e
0 = e[v/x]: = v
a. x[True/x] = True
b. x[3/y] = x
c. (Fun x . x + y)[3/y] = (Fun x.x + 3)
d. (Fun x .(Fun y . x And y))[False/x] = (Fun x .(Fun y . x And y))
e. (Fun y . x And y)[False/x] = (Fun y . False And y)


Problem 4 (5 points). For each of the following CatML expressions e, specify whether there exists e
such that e → e, and if so specify e

a. (Fun y . 3 + y) 
  There does not exist 
b. (Fun y . 3 + y) 5 
  There exists => (3 + 5)
c. (Fun y . 3 + y) False
  There exists => (3 + False)
d. Let f = (Fun y . 3 + y) In (f 2) + (f 3)
  There exists => ((Fun y . (3 + y)) 2 + (Fun y . (3 + y)) 3)
e. (Fix looper . x . looper x) True
  There exists => Fix looper . x . looper x True


Problem 5 (5 points). Which of the expressions in the previous problem:
a. are reducible?
b,d,c,e
b. diverge?
e
c. have a valuation?
a,b,d
d. are stuck?
c
e. go wrong?
c

Problem 6 (5 points). For each of the expression ej that you’ve identified as having a valuation in the
previous problem, provide it’s complete trace from ej to its valuation.


a. 
has a valuation as it is already evaluated (Fun y . 3 + y) 

b. 
(Fun y . (3 + y)) 5
->
(3 + 5)
->
8

d.
Let f = (Fun y . (3 + y)) In
(f 2 + f 3)
->
((Fun y . (3 + y)) 2 + (Fun y . (3 + y)) 3)
->
((3 + 2) + (Fun y . (3 + y)) 3)
->
(5 + (Fun y . (3 + y)) 3)
->
(5 + (3 + 3))
->
(5 + 6)
->
11



Problem 7 (70 points). Complete the CatML interpreter in catml.ml provided in the GitHub repo. See
that file for details.
